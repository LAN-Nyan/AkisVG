# What’s Next?

working hard to release v0.5 by April 1, 2026—so stay tuned! 

# 0.4 Features
- Tool Settings
- Mkv
- Audio
- GIF
- Layer types

# 0.5 Features 
- Add Proper Startup Menu (Fix the existing one, which doesn't show up)
- Increase detail on brush types
- Force Update for the colour picker to show the colour the current tool is (No more Set Pencil to red, click on brush, Colour picker says it's red, but the brush is actually black)
- Fix the Canvas random Offset when changing the Resolution, turning on onion skinning, etc.
- Remove the text part of the toolbar buttons (No more: Icon, + Name! Just Icon)
- Remove settings from the panels menu and give it its own pop-up in the primary toolbar
- Fix the fact that when changing the shape settings, there is no difference between Rounded Vs. Sharp corners, and allow the Line thickness to be changed, and the colour of the fill (which is currently always transparent)  and side lines 
- Add a Startup loading screen for the software (Progress Bar if more than 0.5 seconds have passed since it started)
- Add Interpolation: Create an interpolation layer, then select an area or object, right-click the drop-down menu, click interpolate, and then a spline should appear where you can click to add points above the canvas. In the window title, it should say “Interpolating.” You can right-click on the points to set their frame, and in the timeline, a purple section with white dots should appear on any keyframe you set while interpolating. You can move the dots to the positions you want the selected object group to be, then set a BE HERE BY frame. When the purple line appears, the program should generate the in-between frames. This will be implemented in phases. Phase one: Fix the select tool to allow grouping, create the InterpolationObject Class, and add the Interpolation layer type. Phase two: Add right-click menu and interpolation mode, as well as the visual spline. Phase three: Finish the core of the interpolation, make the actual interpolation part functional.
- Ensure frames CANNOT be drawn in Audio Layers!!!!
- Add Proper Pressure sensitivity and path smoothing
- Clean UI of duplicate functions.
- Ensure everything that is drawn on the canvas is saved as an Object class that can be grouped and saved as a single object for interpolation, or individual objects can be selected for interpolation. Object groups should show up in the asset panel and be copyable anywhere on any frame in the project.
- Make sure UI scaling is consistent across all operating systems, and the colour wheel Triangle and ring are aligned properly.
- Make the fill tool work 100% of the time.
- Add tools like (Zoom tool, Hand Tool, and Magic wand tool)
